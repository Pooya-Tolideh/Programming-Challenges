# Daily Scheduler

I like to divide my total available time into different propotions and assign the largest one to the most important task.
I also use pomodoro technique to stay focused, which means each time portion I assign, must equal to certain number of pomodoro sessions.
My total available time might vary on day to day basis and the process of calculating time portions takes time.
This code is meant to transform my personal productivity routine into a  fast automtic process.
Now I spend less time planning and more time doing.
